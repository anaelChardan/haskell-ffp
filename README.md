### What is functional programming ?

Lambda calculus

Everything relies on mathematical functions:
- Functions as first class citizens
- They are pure or more generally it is referentially transparent
    - Given the same values it return the same result, no side effects!!!
- They can be reduced
- They can be evaluated
- They can be used as arguments to make it composable -> Lego image

A function is something that map arguments to a result.
